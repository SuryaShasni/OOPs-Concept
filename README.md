# OOPs-Concept
 **OOPs** stand for object-oriented programming. It is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects.
### OOPs concept has 5 element
1. Class
2. Objects
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Data Abstraction
### 1) CLASS
A class is a colllection of objects. A class helps in keeping a track of your objects e.g. You need to keep track of 50 candies and now if you use the traditional way that is using list it wont help much beacuse first element can be name of candy and second will be its price and if you do this 50 times it would lack organization.This is where classes come in handy.

### 2) OBJECTS
An object is any entity that exists. e.g. object can be candy's price or its name. <br>X and Y in previous image are objects.
### POLYMORPHISM
This word is derived from greek and means having many forms. Here its use is when parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
+ ![Polymorphism](https://github.com/SuryaShasni/OOPs-Concept/assets/146861918/acb64e7b-a153-4c03-8f77-f74d4224ca64)
### 4) Encapsulation
It is simply encapsuling objects, like a class does. It converts many objects and data in a single unit which helps in operating them easily.

## Another important part is a topic **'Method Overriding'**.
+ Method overriding is an ability that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.
